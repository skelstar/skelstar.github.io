		<h1>Key Competencies</h1>
		
		<p>We believe the key competencies in the New Zealand curriculum focus on learning and social behaviours that encourage children to have a real focus on how they can reach their potential and skills they will enable them to be successful in their future -</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Managing self</li>
			<li>Thinking</li>
			<li>Using language, symbols and texts</li>
			<li>Relating to others</li>
			<li>Participating and contributing</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The school has used Art Costa's 16 Habits of Mind, our CARE programme, our 4CÃ•s and a variety of thinking processes to support the key competencies.</p>
		
		<h1>Individual Values</h1>
		
		<p>Through consultation the school community has identified 8 values that fit alongside the values identified in the new NZ curriculum, to develop and enable all students to work together and effectively in a co-operative way -</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Self-confidence </li>
			<li>Ecological sustainability</li>
			<li>Commitment</li>
			<li>Cooperation</li>
			<li>Integrity</li>
			<li>Kindness</li>
			<li>Thinking positively</li>
			<li>Respecting rules</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The above values are about individual student growth, and are derived from, and complement the direction shown in the overall school values in the Strategic section.</p>
