		<h1>Board of Trustees</h1>
	
		<p>The Muritai School Board of Trustees are representatives elected by the community as the governing body of the school. The Board is responsible for establishing policy objectives and supporting the efficient and effective running of the school.</p>

The School Charter is an important document that specifies what our school is about, what directions it should move in, and provides ideas on how to achieve these goals. The School Charter is reviewed and revised regularly.</p>
		<p>The Board of Trustees meets monthly. Dates are advertised in our school newsletters and parents are welcome to attend.</p>

		<h3>Board Members</h3>
		<p>Stuart Stock (Chairperson), Olivia Paterson, Craig Griffiths, Julie Parker, Nick Brownsword, David Griffiths, Sarah Richardson (staff rep), Andrew Bird (Principal)</p>
