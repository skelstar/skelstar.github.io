<h1>Home and School</h1>
<p>The Muritai Home and School committee is an enthusiastic, energetic group of parents who support Muritai School throughout the year.</p>
<p>Our objective is to provide a link between the children, the home and parents/caregivers, the school and Board of Trustees.  We also support the school through fundraising and social events.</p>
<p>Joining the Committee is a great way to meet new friends, particularly for those who are new in school or the area and who have an interest in the activities of their children at school.</p>
<p>Please consider joining our great Committee.  It is a fantastic way to support your school and become involved in your children's education.  Meetings are held monthly in the school staffroom.</p>
<p>To become involved, simply fill out the Home and School form in the school enrolment pack or contact the school office for details.</p>

<h3>Friends of the Home and School</h3>
<p>This is a new initiative set up by the Home and School Committee in 2008.  It is for those people who do not wish to belong to the Home and School Committee and attend meetings but are willing to lend a helping hand when needed.  Even if you can help only in a small way, it would be very much appreciated.  Examples of activities Friends of the Home and School would be involved with include helping at the school disco, assisting with hot dog selling or setting up the school hall for functions.</p>
<p>Being a Friend of the Home and School can also be a great way to meet other parents in the school while having fun and helping out.</p>
<p>If you are interested in joining this group, please complete the form in the school enrolment pack or contact the school office for details.</p>
