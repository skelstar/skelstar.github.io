		<p>Muritai School enables children to achieve across a broad spectrum of academic, sporting, artistic and social opportunities by providing a varied range of high quality learning opportunities, in partnership with the home, the school and the community.</p> 
		
		<p>We aim to make a difference in children's lives through working together to provide:</p>

			<li>a safe, supportive, friendly environment based on respect. Fun, enjoyment and happiness are part of our schoolÕs special character</li>
			<li>high expectations and innovative, appropriate and challenging learning opportunities</li>
			<li>recognition for all forms of participation, effort and success</li>
		</ul>

		<p><b>What does success look like?</b></p> 

		<ul>
			<li>Our children will demonstrate high levels of achievement in the key curriculum subjects of reading, writing and mathematics.</li>  
			<li>Our definition of success though is a broad notion, not solely academic.</li> 
			<li>Children will also succeed through Inquiry and the Integrated Curriculum, in the Arts and with their physical skills.</li>  
			<li>Our children demonstrate a love of learning and want to come to school.</li> 
			<li>Our children show self-belief, with every child prepared to take a risk and make a positive contribution.</li>  
			<li>Our children are determined Ð they are able to learn from failure and move on.</li> 
			<li>School, parents, caregivers and the Eastbourne community can be seen working in partnership to educate children at the school.</li>
		</ul>
