    <h1>Vision</h1>

    <p>Muritai students will be the best that they can be.</p>
    <p>The vision for everyone involved with Muritai School is that the children's education will help them develop their potential to be the best that they can possibly be.</p>
    <p>Children leaving Muritai will have developed the skills and attitudes to be high achieving, independent, self-motivated learners, eager to further their education. Our expectation is that our children will become confident, self-assured individuals with a strong set of skills to face the challenges of secondary school.</p>
    <p>Our focus as a school is to reflect on and review our achievements and develop new goals and strategies to enhance our school learning environment to improve outcomes for each and every student.</p>
    <p>We recognize that achieving our vision involves contributions from our whole school community. In particular, we must support our staff to be the best that they can be.</p>
