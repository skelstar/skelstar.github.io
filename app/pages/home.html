		<p>Muritai School aims to make a difference in children&rsquo;s lives by developing together through great teaching, focused learning and caring about each other so 'we can all be the best that we can be'. </p>
		<p>The school is in the heart of the village of Eastbourne, a small, seaside community on the edge of Wellington Harbour.&nbsp;Eastbourne has a beautiful environment, nestled between the sea and the bush, and close community atmosphere. Our children are keen to make the most of this special place.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Muritai was opened in 1897 and has a strong history of success.&nbsp; It has a proud tradition of being a focal point in the Eastbourne community and has always enjoyed a high level of community support and involvement. As a full primary school we cater for children from New Entrants up to Year 8 and we are extremely proud of the safe, caring, family atmosphere our full primary status provides.</p>
		<p>Muritai School is a wonderful school. We would welcome the opportunity to share our philosophy of learning and achievement with you.&nbsp;</p>
